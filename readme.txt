This is part of students project at Pedagogical University of Cracow.

This is part of task "Finding human bodies on images using Python" solved by Kamil Morawiecki in 2 different approaches.

We were trying to get bests results of finding human bodies on images using simple python script.
Using Haar Cascade Classifier of human body representation we got very unpleasent results, no metter configuration.
This weak solution is in location: '/using_Haar_Cascade_Classifier'. All specific information required to run this code
You can find in readme file located in this catalog.

Much better solution is located at: '/using_ImageAI'. It uses Keras at backend (we don't need to know anything about Keras).
Results are much better than in Haar Cascade Classifier, hovewer computing time is longer. All specific information required to run this code
You can find in readme file located in this catalog.
